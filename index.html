      <h2>Working on being a Fullstack Developer</h2>
      <p>Hi guys, I worked in a Microfinance Institution that is part of the Aga Khan Development Network as a Digital Financial Product Manager in Madagascar. In partnership with Orange, we launched a fully digital savings and credit service accessible through the mobile phone with a mission to disrupt the Malagasy financial sector by delivering formal financial services to people that are financially excluded or undeserved. I worked on the business side of the product design and got interested in the tech side of it and the 'agile' approach. That is why I am doing the coding bootcamp!</p>
